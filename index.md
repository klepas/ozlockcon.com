## <b>Post Conference</b>

The conference went great with over 200 people in attendance from all over.  Thank you to everyone who came and made it such a great success.

Slides and vidoes will be coming out as soon as possible.  These will be available over on the **[2017 speakers page](/2017/speakers/)**.

To avoid confusion and to better reflect the focus of the conference OzLockCon will be renaming to OzSecCon in 2018.

We hope to see you all there with the conference growing and with new exciting presentations and workshops.

Thanks again!

## What's this?

OzSecCon is the first open community event on physical security in Australia.

The conference focus is on both analogue and digital physical security systems and is open to professionals and hobbyists alike.

The 2-day event will provide a community space to share expertise on tools and techniques to learn new skills and refine existing ones.

Included are:

- talks
- workshops
- and a variety of competitions (with prizes!)

Our sessions will be open to all attendees, run by industry-leading instructors across a range of topics.

Our aim is to cover not only traditional physical security controls (such as locks and safes) but also access control systems (alarm systems and <abbr title="Radio-frequency Identification">RFID</abbr>). This will include both networked and <abbr title="radio frequency">RF</abbr> devices.

We hope that all those attending find the experience both informative, engaging, and importantly, fun.

### Talks

Talks will be range from 30â€“60 minutes long on all things physical security.

We will have some of the best talent in the world attend and present both
time-honoured techniques as well as the latest research.

### Workshops

Workshops are run by experts who will demonstrate attacks such as:

- impressioning
- picking
- safe manipulation
- bumping
- bypass techniques
- <abbr title="Radio-frequency Identification">RFID</abbr>/radio attacks
- and more.

These provide an excellent opportunity to practice and refine your skills regardless of expertise.

Workshops will run anywhere between an hour to all-weekend long without fixed class sizes.

### Demonstrations

Similar to workshops, but not hands on. These will demo advanced skills such as destructive entry techniques, safe repair, lock making, and more.

### Competitions

Lock-picking and handcuff evasion competitions have become increasingly popular across infosec conferences in Australia. These have usually attracted a fairly small and relatively inexperienced crowd, with familiar faces showing up at most events.

At OzSecCon we aim to find out who the best lock-picker in Australia is by testing their skills and knowledge.

More details as to the format and types of competitions will be announced closer to the date.
