## What's this?

OzLockCon aims to be the first open and inclusive community event focusing on
physical security controls in Australia.

The con aims to introduce people from all areas of security, whether
professionals or hobbyists, to new techniques, tools, and ideas in order to
learn new skills or refine them.

We hope to have both standard talks and a variety of on-going workshops open to
attendees with industry-leading presenters and tutors.

## Conference date

The conference is scheduled to run in early 2017, likely around April/May and
will be held in either Sydney or Melbourne.

Stay tuned

## What's the plan?

We are aiming to provide a variety of content at OzLockCon.

### Talks

Talks are %length_long% on all things physical security.

We aim to have some of the best talent in the world attend and present both
time-honoured techniques as well as cutting edge research.

### Workshops

Workshops are run by experts who will demonstrate attacks such as
impressioning, lock picking, safe manipulation, bumping, bypass techniques
and more. These provide an excellent opportunity to practice and refine both old
and new skills.

Workshops span %length% to all-day long.

### Demonstrations

Similar to workshops, but just demonstrative. Demos cover advanced techniques
such as destructive entry techniques, safe repair, lock making, etc.

### Competitions

For the past few years, Australia has had several lock picking competitions run
at 'information security' conferences. These have usually attracted a fairly
small and relatively inexperienced crowd with familiar faces showing up at most
events.

At OzLockCon, we aim to find out who the best lock-picker in Australia is by
testing their skills and knowledge. Details forthcoming.

### Panel

On the final day we will be running a panel consisting of %key_people%
(inc. Law Enforcement, MLA?, Abloy/LW, LockSporter, Pentester,. (Details TBC)
