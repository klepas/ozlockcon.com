title: "OzLockCon 2017 June 3-4"
---

## What's this?

OzLockCon is the first open and inclusive community event focusing on
both analogue and digital physical security in Australia.

The conference will introduce people from all areas of security, whether
professionals or hobbyists, to new techniques, tools and ideas in order to learn
new skills or refine existing ones.

We will have both standard talks and a variety of on-going workshops open to 
attendees with industry-leading presenters and instructors across a diverse 
range of topics. In addition, we will be running a variety of competitions 
throughout the weekend with prizes on offer for those who win!

Our aim is to cover not only traditional physical security controls (such as
locks and safes) but more modern access control systems that are increasingly
becoming more digital as time goes on. This will not only include
network-connected devices but also devices such as those relying on radio 
communications in order to operate.

We hope that all those attending find the experience both informative, engaging
and importantly, fun! 

## What's the plan?

The conference will run on the 3rd and 4th of June 2017 and be held in Melbourne
at "The Comics Lounge" located at 26 Errol St, North Melbourne VIC 3051 and be held 
from 10AM to 6PM each day.

Content will include...

### Talks

Talks will be anywhere from 30-60 minutes long on all things physical security.

We will have some of the best talent in the world attend and present both
time-honoured techniques as well as cutting edge research.

### Workshops

Workshops are run by experts who will demonstrate attacks such as
impressioning, lock picking, safe manipulation, bumping, bypass techniques
and more. These provide an excellent opportunity to practice and refine both old and new skills.

Workshops will run anywhere between an hour to all-day long and classes will be of various sizes. 

### Demonstrations

Similar to workshops, but not hands on. Demos will cover and show advanced techniques
such as destructive entry techniques, safe repair, lock making, etc. 

### Competitions

For the past few years, Australia has had several lock picking competitions run
at 'information security' conferences. These have usually attracted a fairly
small and relatively inexperienced crowd with familiar faces showing up at most
events.

At OzLockCon, we aim to find out who the best lock-picker in Australia is by
testing their skills and knowledge. More details as to the format and types of 
competitions will be announced closer to the date. 

### Panel

On the final day we will be running a panel consisting of industry leaders and various
experts including law enforcement, information security professionals, inudstry 
representatives and hobbyists disucssing a wide variety of topics regarding physical
security in Australia and around the world.
