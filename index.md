## Announcement May 23

### [Schedule announced](/schedule)

After much juggling (of about double the content we brought you last year) the schedule is up!

Weâ€™ve tried hard to minimise overlap:

- A single talk track
  - talks are run both days in the David Willis Auditorium
- Workshops:
  - several workshops are run both days;
  - shorter or one-off workshops are timed to best avoid major clashes.

### Competitions

As last year, each competition is run at its respective workshop:

- [Lockpicking](/schedule/#lockpicking)
- [Impressioning](/schedule/#impressioning)
- [Tamper evidence challenge](/schedule/#tamper-evidence-challenge)

## Venue

OzSecCon is excited to announce our venue for 2018 will be the fantastic Melbourne Polytechnic venue located in West Heidelberg, this venue is also used to teach young professional locksmiths and we have graciously been granted access to use the locksmithing and metalworking departments for our demonstrations and workshops.

This, in conjunction with multiple classrooms and lecture theatres means we will be able to run multiple different activities simultaneously throughout the weekend.

The locksmithing and metalworking departments are located in building B, in the north-west of the campus.  

For more on the campus venue, see the [the Melbourne Polytechnic Heidelberg campus page](https://www.melbournepolytechnic.edu.au/campuses/heidelberg).

## What's this?

OzSecCon is the first open community event on physical security in Australia.

The conference focus is on both analogue and digital physical security systems and is open to professionals and hobbyists alike.

The 2-day event will provide a community space to share expertise on tools and techniques to learn new skills and refine existing ones.

Included are:

- talks
- workshops
- and a variety of competitions (with prizes!)

Our sessions will be open to all attendees, run by industry-leading instructors across a range of topics.

Our aim is to cover not only traditional physical security controls (such as locks and safes) but also access control systems (alarm systems and <abbr title="Radio-frequency Identification">RFID</abbr>). This will include both networked and <abbr title="radio frequency">RF</abbr> devices.

We hope that all those attending find the experience both informative, engaging, and importantly, fun.
