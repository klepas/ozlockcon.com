This is our Code of Conduct. We encourage everyone to read it. If you have any
questions, concerns, or suggestions we ask you to **<a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">contact us</a>**.

<small>Our code has been adapted from the [*Citizen Code of Conduct*](http://citizencodeofconduct.org/).</small>


## Purpose

<small>[ §1 ]</small>

A primary goal of OzLockCon is to be inclusive to the largest number of people interested in locksport, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

OzLockCon encourages the sharing of information about all things so that people can be better informed and make better informed decisions.  We are also firm believers in the belief that lock sport is a great hobby that can be enjoyed by anyone.

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in OzLockCon, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behaviour.

We invite all those who participate in OzLockCon to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.


## Open citizenship

<small>[ §2 ]</small>

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open [source/culture/tech] citizenship by encouraging participants to recognise and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.

If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and who encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, commend them and/or let us know.


## Expected behaviour

<small>[ §3 ]</small>

The following behaviours are expected and requested of all conference members:

- Please participate in an active and/or authentic way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
- Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
- Attempt collaboration before conflict.
- Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behaviour and speech.
- Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert the OzLockCon Consmiths if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.
- Remember that community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.
- Although our staff endeavour to supervise where possible, we can't be everywhere at once: it is your responsibility to look after any tools or other personal assets you bring along.


## Unacceptable behaviour

<small>[ §4 ]</small>

The following behaviours are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our conference:

- Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.
- Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
- Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material. This _especially_ includes sexualised marketing and uniforms, viz., ‘booth babes’.
- Posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information ("doxing").
- Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.
- Inappropriate photography or recording.
- Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someone’s consent before touching them.
- Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualised comments or jokes; inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances.
- Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour.
- Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations.
- Anything illegal (duh).
- Photography without the consent of ALL parties in the photograph. Please take care to avoid photographing any participant without their explicit consent and delete any images if requested.


## Consequences of unacceptable behaviour

<small>[ §5 ]</small>

Unacceptable behaviour of any sort, listed here explicity or not, from any conference-goer, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, **will not be tolerated**.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behaviour is expected to comply immediately.

If a conference-goer engages in unacceptable behaviour, the OzLockCon Consmiths may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the conference without warning, or the calling of local police.

We do not condone any form of illegal activity and anyone found to have intent to commit a crime, or with a history of committing crimes will be subsequently expelled from the event and reported to the police. Delegates are encouraged to report anyone who they believe to be acting suspiciously to the staff.

Anyone who is expelled should not expect to receive a refund.


## Reporting guidelines

<small>[ §6 ]</small>

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behaviour, or have any other concerns, please notify a anyone from the OzLockCon Consmiths as soon as possible. You can also **<a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">email us</a>**.

Additionally, OzLockCon Consmiths are available to help conference-goers engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behaviour feel safe. In the context of in-person events, organisers will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.


## Addressing grievances

<small>[ §7 ]</small>

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify the event organisers with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled jointly by the OzLockCon Consmiths. As necessary, we may seek legal advice, and seek an outcome directed in the spirit of this Code of Conduct.

We may chose to make public reference to a warning during and/or after the event, in a general manner. In the event of an expulsion or otherwise serious breach of the Code of Conduct, we will publicly make reference to the breach, while respecting first and foremost the desired privacy of any victim(s).


## Scope

<small>[ §8 ]</small>

We expect all participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all conference venues–online and in-person–as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to conference business.

This Code of Conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behaviour occurring outside the scope of conference activities when such behaviour has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of conference members.
