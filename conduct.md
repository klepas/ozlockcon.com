This is our community’s Code of Conduct. We encourage everyone to read it. If you have any questions, concerns, or suggestions we ask you to **<a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">contact us</a>**.

Our code has been adapted from the [*Citizen Code of Conduct*](http://citizencodeofconduct.org/).

## 1. Purpose

A primary goal of OzLockCon is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behaviour.

We invite all those who participate in OzLockCon to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

## 2. Open citizenship

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open [source/culture/tech] citizenship by encouraging participants to recognise and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.

If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and who encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, commend them and/or let us know.

## 3. Expected behaviour

The following behaviours are expected and requested of all community members:

- Please participate in an active and/or authentic way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
- Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
- Attempt collaboration before conflict.
- Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behaviour and speech.
- Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.
- Remember that community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.

## 4. Unacceptable behaviour

The following behaviours are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:

- Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.
- Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
- Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
- Posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information ("doxing").
- Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.
- Inappropriate photography or recording.
- Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someone’s consent before touching them.
- Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualised comments or jokes; inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances.
- Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour.
- Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations.

## 5. Consequences of unacceptable behaviour

Unacceptable behaviour from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, **will not be tolerated**.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behaviour is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behaviour, the community organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning, or the calling of local police.

Anyone who is expelled should not expect to receive a refund.

## 6. Reporting guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behaviour, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organiser as soon as possible. You can also **<a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">email us</a>**.

Additionally, community organisers are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behaviour feel safe. In the context of in-person events, organisers will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.

## 7. Addressing grievances

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify the event organisers with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled jointly by the organisers. As necessary, we may seek legal advice, and seek an outcome directed in the spirit of this Code of Conduct.

We may chose to make public reference to a warning during and/or after the event, in a general manner. In the event of an expulsion or otherwise serious breach of the Code of Conduct, we will publicly make reference to the breach, while respecting first and foremost the desired privacy of any victim(s).

## 8. Scope

We expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues–online and in-person–as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.

This code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behaviour occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behaviour has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.
