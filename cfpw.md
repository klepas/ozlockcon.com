## Call for Papers

OzSecCon is the first conference in Australia focused specifically on physical security research and offensive/defensive techniques. Talks will be on average 30-60 minutes long.

We aim to bring the openness to share information found in conferences of the information security industry to a different crowd.

### Submissions

<small>If your topic isn't listed here but relates to physical security, please submit anyway and we will be happy to review it.</small>

<small>Submissions that have nothing to do with physical security will be rejected.</small>

## Call for Workshops

In addition to traditional 'talks' (like at most other conferences), OzSecCon will have hands-on content.

We are looking for people to run workshops. These can run anywhere between an hour to the full course of the conference.

Some workshop topic ideas are as follows:

- impressioning
- picking
- safe manipulation
- bumping
- bypass techniques
- <abbr title="Radio-frequency Identification">RFID</abbr>/radio attacks
- and more.

<small>If you require financial assistance in order to run such a workshop (eg. to purchase a large number of key blanks and files to teach impressioning techniques) please let us know in your submission and we'll try to help you out.</small>
