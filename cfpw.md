## Call for Papers

OzLockCon will be the first conference in Australia specifically on physical security research and offensive/defensive techniques.

We aim to bring the openness to share information found in conferences of the information security industry to a different crowd.

So, some topic ideas:

* decoding attacks
* safe manipulation
* the locksport community and our hobby
* historical/antique locks
* privilege escalation attacks

* social engineering

<small>If your topic isn't listed here but relates to physical security, please submit anyway and we will be happy to review it.</small>

<small>Submissions that have nothing to do with physical security will be rejected.</small>

## Call for Workshops

In addition to traditional 'talks' (like at most other conferences), OzLockCon will have hands-on content.

We are looking for people to run workshops. These can run anywhere between an hour to the full course of the conference.

<small>If you require financial assistance in order to run such a workshop (eg. to purchase a large number of key blanks and files to teach impressioning techniques) please let us know in your submission and we'll try to help you out.</small>
