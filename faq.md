## Who are you?

We are a loose-knit group of physical security enthusiasts. We come from a diverse range of backgrounds; some of us work in security (eg. as locksmiths or in IT security), but we're all locksport hobbyists --- what binds us all is our common interest and passion for locks.

In early 2016 we started a chat channel as a place for us to share knowledge about physical security. For the most part we grew from 'hacker-conferences' and as such we've embraced the hacker spirit of sharing information: teaching each other and learning together.

We aim to be like the conferences that occur in Europe and the US. We hope one day that the Australian locksport and physical security community can be regarded as highly as our fellow communities overseas.

## Is this legal?

Yes. In our opinion, this conference is no different to information security/‘hacker’ conferences which is where this community stems from.

## Is possession of lockpicking tools legal?

See [*Review of Maximum Penalties for Preparatory Offences Report*](https://www.sentencingcouncil.vic.gov.au/sites/default/files/publication-documents/Review%20of%20Maximum%20Penalties%20for%20Preparatory%20Offences%20Report.pdf) (<small>§3.5 & §3.6</small>).

The summary of this is --- according to our interpretation --- that possession of lock picking equipment is legal as long as a reasonable explanation can be demonstrated. We are however, not lawyers. If this is of particular concern to you, it would be our recommendation that you consult a lawyer for legal advice.

## How do I travel by air with locksport equipment?

Many of us do this regularly as part of our work and hobby.

We recommend you place all tools *and locks* into your checked-in luggage. Why locks too? Most airport screeners will consider a 45mm padlock a potential weapon.

Hard moulded plastic cases are ideal and can often also be locked. Regular bags and suitcases are fine too provided that sensitive tools (eg. picks) are secure from being squashed to avoid gross frustration upon unpacking.

## Aren't you teaching wannabe criminals?

We hope not. Anyone found to have criminal intent attending the conference will be summarily booted *and* reported to the authorities.

Additionally, we're going to borrow a quote as an answer:

> Rogues knew a good deal about lock-picking long before locksmiths discussed it [...] If a lock is not so inviolable as it has hitherto been deemed to be, surely it is to the interest of honest persons to know this fact, because the dishonest are... certain to apply the knowledge practically… the spread of the knowledge is necessary to give fair play to those who might suffer by ignorance.

## Hackers Helping Hackers

OzLockCon is stepping up to help hackers, locksmiths and others in need.

Currently, the organisation known as [*Hackers Helping Hackers*](https://hackershelpinghackers.com/) is sorting out their charity status paperwork out so they can continue doing their amazing work.

For this year they have advised us to take applications directly. As a result of this, the application is a slimmed down and slightly modified version of HHH's application.

Applicants will be notified at least one month prior to the conference, to the decision regarding their application. This will occur sooner if logistics allows it.

If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to [email us directly](mailto:admin@ozlockcon.com).

Otherwise, please submit a **[Hackers Helping Hackers application](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1YzfjMOSIwRfWDwsnS8s3tP6ZzFFip3HrksgYfAS10rQ/)**.
