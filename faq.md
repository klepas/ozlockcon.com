## Who are you?

We are a loose knit group of physical security enthusiasts. We come from a wide
variety of backgrounds; some of us are security professionals such as locksmiths
and IT security professionals, but we're all locksport hobbyists -- what binds
us all is our common interest and passion for locks.

In early 2016 we started a chat channel as a place for like-minded people to
discuss and share knowledge around physical security. For the most part, we
grew from 'hacker-conferences' and as such, we've embraced the hacker spirit of
sharing information, teaching each other and learning together.

We aim to be like the conferences that occur in Europe and the US and hope one
day that the Australian locksport and physical security community can be
regarded as highly as our fellow communities overseas.

We hope that the knowledge we share will be used for the betterment of all of us
and that the result of the conference will be a greater awareness of the
challenges faced when dealing with physical security. We also hope that those
that attend enjoy and compete in the competitions and/or workshops, we have
planned. 


## Is this legal?

Yes. In our opinion, this is no different to information security/‘hacker’
conferences which is where this community primarily grew from. 


## Is possession of lockpicking tools legal?

[Some information that is relevant](https://www.sentencingcouncil.vic.gov.au/sites/default/files/publication-documents/Review%20of%20Maximum%20Penalties%20for%20Preparatory%20Offences%20Report.pdf).
The summary of this is, according to our interpretation, that possession of lock 
picking equipment is legal as long as a reasonable explanation can be demonstrated for such. 
We are however, not lawyers. If this is of particular concern to you, it would be
our reccomendation that you consult a professional lawyer for legal advice. 

## Aren't you teaching wannabe criminals?

We hope not. Anyone found to have criminal intent attending the conference
will be summarily booted and reported to the authorities. 

We're going to borrow a quote as an answer:

> Rogues knew a good deal about lock-picking long before locksmiths discussed it
[...] If a lock is not so inviolable as it has hitherto been deemed to be,
surely it is to the interest of honest persons to know this fact, because the
dishonest are... certain to apply the knowledge practically… the spread of the
knowledge is necessary to give fair play to those who might suffer by ignorance.
