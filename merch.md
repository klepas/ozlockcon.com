## Merchandise

Though we have a teespring shop, we’ve realised the shipping costs of **[teespring shop](https://teespring.com/stores/ozlockcon)** makes merchandise somewhat inaccessible so we've created this initative.

For a limited time, we’re accepting orders where shipping will be at a flat rate of $15* but our teespring shop will be avalible all year round should you miss out.

All shirts have both male and female versions.  In your order please specify which version you want.

Please place all order by ***midnight on Sunday 4th of June 2017***.
<br /> <br />

### To place an order
For more information or to ***place an order, please contact Lana by [email](mailto:alannahguo@gmail.com) or you can find her at the conference!***
