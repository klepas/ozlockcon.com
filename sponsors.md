## Interested in being a sponsor?

OzLockCon will be the first locksport and physical security conference in Australia. We have created an online community for physical security enthusiasts including locksmiths, information security professionals, and hobbyists.

The conference aims to bring this community together to share knowledge and build awareness around physical security, and to both enable and inspire future research.

We expect to accommodate at least 200 security professionals and hobbyists to this event. Our expectation is that this event will be run ‘at cost’ with all funds going towards providing the best experience we can possibly offer for everyone involved.

We aim to run a combination of talks, several workshops, and a number of competitions. This should allow attendees to both learn by listening and through hands-on opportunities.

With this in mind, the funds allocated from sponsorship will hopefully cover the costs of the workshop materials as well as the costs of guest speakers from around the world.

While this is the first time OzLockCon has been organised, the team running the conference has for several years been heavily involved with running similar sized information security conferences across Australia and New Zealand. These include:

- [AppSec Day](https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/owasp-melbourne-appsec-day-tickets-27378844862#)
- [AusCERT](https://conference.auscert.org.au/)
- [BSides Canberra](http://bsidesau.com.au/)
- [CrikeyCon](https://www.crikeycon.com/)
- [Kiwicon](https://kiwicon.org/)
- [Platypus Con](https://letsjusthackshit.org/platypuscon2016.html)
- [Ruxcon](https://ruxcon.org.au/)
- [Unrestcon](http://unre.st)
- [WAHCKon](https://wahckon.org.au/)
