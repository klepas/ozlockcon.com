## Interested in being a sponsor?

OzLockCon will be the first locksport and physical security conference in Australia. We have created an online community for physical security enthusiasts ranging from locksmiths to information security professionals.
Our hope is to bring the community together create a conference where we can share knowledge and build awareness around physical security.

We are aiming to provide a wide range of experiences for attendees and expect to accommodate 200 security professionals and hobbyists to this event. Our expectation is that this event will be run ‘at cost’ with all funds going towards providing the best experience we can possibly offer for everyone involved.

We aim to run one main ‘speaker track’ alongside several other workshops running in parallel. This should allow attendees to both learn by listening and through hands-on workshops.
While this is the first time OzLockCon has been organised, the team running the conference has for several years, been heavily involved with running similar sized information security conferences across Australia.

We ask that you consider the sponsorship packages below in order to help the community to grow and learn:
