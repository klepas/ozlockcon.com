  title: Elements of Lock Cylinder Design Cylinders & Keys made with Moveable Elements
  abstract: >
      ***Elements of Lock Cylinder Design*** is an overview of the parts or elements that make a lock cylinder, and the comparison of how variations in the individual elements can   increase or decrease the security of the lock.


      By analyzing the components in a cylinder, it is possible to develop a summary of the security rating of the lock. We will use illustrations and photographs of the cylinder  to understand how various locks operate.


      ***Cylinders and Keys made with Moveable Elements*** is a historical study of locks that are operated by keys with moveable components. In the late 1900s there was a rapid   development of locks with mechanically complex keys.


      We will use illustrations and photographs to see what the lock and keys look like, how they operate and estimatewhat security they provide.

      Many of the locks that have been manufactured and sold in China represent significant cylinder inventions that areoften overlooked.

      Using photographs, illustrations and video animations, we will evaluate several clever cylinder ideas and see how they have been manufactured, modied and incorporated into other models. We will also introduce some new products recently developed in China.

      Be prepared to delve into the realm of tamper resistance by-passes with this interactive presentation.

      Having discovered tamper-resistance by-passes over a year ago, Connor and Emily wish to share their enthusiasm and experiences in bypassing a variety of tamper resistance devices.  In doing so, demonstrarting that tamper resistance really is just child's play.


      The presentation will demonstrate the use of a number of solvents and their application to tamper resistance by-passes and as well basic hand-cuff and cable tie removal. A must-see presentation for those wanting to get into tamper-proof by-passing.

      Disc detainer locks form a small, but fascinating area within the locksport world. This talk will shed some light on the operation and vulnerabilities of several high security mechanisms in use today, including locks made by Abus and Abloy. It will also cover several techniques on how to NDE them and some of the NDE countermeasures employed by lock makers.


      This talk will draw on my limited but useful experience as a lockpicker and toolmaker, specialising in disc detainer locks.

      If you've ever wanted an invisibility cloak, this talk is for you.


      Cameras peer at us from street corners, from phones, from the dashes of passing cars, and from shopping mall advertisements. Even when you're not posing for a selfie, you might end up in the background of someone else's picture while you're out at dinner – and if that photograph is uploaded to a social media site, facial recognition can pick you out of the lineup.

      Machines are getting better at recognising our faces – but if you want to sneak through the streets of your city like a young wizard in the corridors after midnight, there is still hope.

      This talk provides an overview of the latest urban camouflage technology and how to deploy it in order to foil facial recognition. During this session you'll learn the ways machines "see" us, and how to play with them in order to become invisible. We'll dive into the ethics of biometric identification. And, if you're feeling adventurous, you can have fun with reflective tape and face paint to disguise yourselves from the algorithmic eye.

    quite a few to be hard to pick, is used in quite a few new commercial installations, especial
    in high security areas, but not much beyond marketing and 1 bosnianbill video talk about
    how it functions and how it can be attacked. In this talk I will cover most of the design and

He picked his first lock out of curiosity, but his curiosity wasn’t satisfied with just being able to pick locks he wanted to see how they worked, he wanted to see inside the locks. After taking a machining course he did just that. From this endeavor Anarchy Won Metalworks was born. Currently focused on lock cutaways Chris hopes to branch out into custom metal work soon.

    Have you seen pictures of cutaway locks floating around online and wondered how they are made? Or have you ever wondered what it would look like if you could peel away the layers of a lock to see what’s going on inside?

    This presentation is an in-depth look at how cutaway locks are made primarily using manual Milling machines. You don’t have to be a machinist to enjoy this talk. Afterwards join the speaker in a live demo where you can watch locks being turned into cutaways.

    Project Walrus, an RFID and Contactless Card Cloning App
  abstract: >
    Walrus is an Android app that supports several existing contactless card cloning devices. Walrus is designed to simplify and streamline card cloning during red team engagements and physical security assessments.


    It offers a common interface and database for storing cloned cards. Currently Walrus supports the industry standard Proxmark 3, Chameleon Mini, Tastic RFID Thief, and more to come. Cloned cards are written to a blank card or emulated on another device such as the Proxmark, instantly granting the attacker privileged access to restricted areas.


    Our presentation demonstrates how Walrus is capable of tapping into the power of the 'Tastic RFID Thief' long range card reader, enabling walk-by cloning of access cards in seconds, as well as how cloned cards can be integrated across multiple devices.

    A password shouldn’t be on a post-it note.

    In plain view.

    On the console.


    The password to a locked door is called a key.


    So if a reporter wants to get the point across that certain people shouldn't have access to a particular key, would it be wise for said reporter to show that key to the world? This talk will show how not to run this story, why we should care and maybe make you rethink your physical security a bit

    Drinking Tea and Holding Meetings: How to do a bad job of PhySec Redteaming and still pwn your target
  abstract: >
    Imagine doing a Physical Security Assessment where the client tells you all the cool stuff like wearing fake uniforms, card cloning, and lockpicking are out of scope. You have to try and gain access to the organisation's buildings with essentially nothing but your (limited) wit and charm. But they didn't say the kitchen is out of scope. Big mistake. We'll share a story of how a cup of tea is like an invisibility cloak, your target's meeting rooms make an impenetrable base of operations, and how people are inherently so helpful they will literally go out of their way to help you break into their organisation.
