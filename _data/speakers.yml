    title: Elements of Lock Cylinder Design Cylinders & Keys made with Moveable Elements
    abstract: >
      ***Elements of Lock Cylinder Design*** is an overview of the parts or elements that make a lock cylinder, and the comparison of how variations in the individual elements can   increase or decrease the security of the lock.


      By analyzing the components in a cylinder, it is possible to develop a summary of the security rating of the lock. We will use illustrations and photographs of the cylinder  to understand how various locks operate.


      ***Cylinders and Keys made with Moveable Elements*** is a historical study of locks that are operated by keys with moveable components. In the late 1900s there was a rapid   development of locks with mechanically complex keys.


      We will use illustrations and photographs to see what the lock and keys look like, how they operate and estimatewhat security they provide.

    title: Interesting Chinese Cylinder Innovations
    abstract: >
      Many of the locks that have been manufactured and sold in China represent significant cylinder inventions that areoften overlooked.

      Using photographs, illustrations and video animations, we will evaluate several clever cylinder ideas and see how they have been manufactured, modied and incorporated into other models. We will also introduce some new products recently developed in China.

    title: Tamper Resistance Bypasses
    abstract: >
      Be prepared to delve into the realm of tamper resistance by-passes with this interactive presentation.

      Having discovered tamper-resistance by-poasses over a year ago, Connor and Emily wish to share their enthusiasm and experiences in bypassing a variety of tamper resistance devices.  In doing so, demon strarting that tamper resistance really is just child's play.


      The presentation will demonstrate the use of a number of solvents and their application to tamper resistance by-passes and as well basic hand-cuff and cable tie removal. A must-see presentation for those wanting to get into tamper-proof by-passing.

  workshop:
    title: Impressioning with Jos Weyers and Holly Poer
    abstract: >
      This is a very special workshop on impressioning, a covert entry technique used to generate a working key for a lock given only information obtained by manipulating a ***blank key*** in a lock. Unlike lockpicking, impressioning creates a fully working key for the lock which can be used to lock and unlock the cylinder at will. With practice, this technique can consistently create a key in 10-15 minutes ( and potentially faster! ). This will be a full, hands-on workshop on this technique.

      Disc detainer locks form a small, but fascinating area within the locksport world. This talk will shed some light on the operation and vulnerabilities of several high security mechanisms in use today, including locks made by Abus and Abloy. It will also cover several techniques on how to NDE them and some of the NDE countermeasures employed by lock makers.


      This talk will draw on my limited but useful experience as a lockpicker and toolmaker, specialising in disc

    title: How to Disappear Completely
    abstract: >
      If you've ever wanted an invisibility cloak, this talk is for you.


      Cameras peer at us from street corners, from phones, from the dashes of passing cars, and from shopping mall advertisements. Even when you're not posing for a selfie, you might end up in the background of someone else's picture while you're out at dinner – and if that photograph is uploaded to a social media site, facial recognition can pick you out of the lineup.

      Machines are getting better at recognising our faces – but if you want to sneak through the streets of your city like a young wizard in the corridors after midnight, there is still hope.
      
      This talk provides an overview of the latest urban camouflage technology and how to deploy it in order to foil facial recognition. During this session you'll learn the ways machines "see" us, and how to play with them in order to become invisible. We'll dive into the ethics of biometric identification. And, if you're feeling adventurous, you can have fun with reflective tape and face paint to disguise yourselves from the algorithmic eye.
