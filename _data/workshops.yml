      This is a very special workshop on impressioning, a covert entry technique used to generate a working key for a lock given only information obtained by manipulating a ***blank key*** in a lock. Unlike lockpicking, impressioning creates a fully working key for the lock which can be used to lock and unlock the cylinder at will. With practice, this technique can consistently create a key in 10–15 minutes (and potentially faster!). This will be a full, hands-on workshop on this technique.

  whois: Google is hosting this tamper evidence challenge to engage curiosity about the physical integrity aspects of local access attacks.
  title: Tamper Evidence Challenge
  abstract: >
    Physical seals are intended to provide assurance that the sealed object has not been tampered with --- to detect theft, contamination or unauthorised access. This challenge will be a hands-on, participant-led exercise in attempting to defeat a number of different tamper evident seals of dramatically different strengths and weaknesses, and also show some ways to detect tampering. Fame and glory will be awarded to participants who succeed in defeating each kind of seal.

    The purpose of this workshop is to provide participants with a series of hands on activities involving the compromise of a few consumer grade physical security systems. Within the IOT and consumer technology space, the sole dependency on physical security, obfuscation or inaccessibility of code or interfaces in readily exploitable products whose core functions can be negated or used for a contrary purpose. This workshop will take its participants through two such devices, and will demonstrate how a failure in understanding security concepts or the threat actors these systems face resulted in the systems providing a false sense of security.
