  abstract: >
      This is a very special workshop on impressioning, a covert entry technique used to generate a working key for a lock given only information obtained by manipulating a ***blank key*** in a lock. Unlike lockpicking, impressioning creates a fully working key for the lock which can be used to lock and unlock the cylinder at will. With practice, this technique can consistently create a key in 10-15 minutes ( and potentially faster! ). This will be a full, hands-on workshop on this technique.

  whois: Google is hosting this tamper evidence challenge to engage curiosity about the physicalintegrity aspects of local access attacks.
  title: Tamper Evidence Challenge
  abstract: >
    Physical seals are intended to provide assurance that the sealed object has not been tamperedwith - to detect theft, contamination or unauthorised access. This challenge will be a hands-on, participant-led exercise in attempting to defeat a number of different tamper evident seals of dramatically different strengths and weaknesses, and also show some ways to detect tampering. Fame and glory will be awarded to participants who succeed in defeating each kind of seal.
